Calgary is a mountain-high city, and the climate - directly related to the altitude - is dry. Temperatures are mild, especially when compared to most of Canada, and even when it’s cold, it’s usually sunny. 

In fact, the sun shines an average of 2,300 hours every year, making Calgary the sunniest major city in the country.

But Calgary weather is definitely unpredictable.</p>
